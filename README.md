# AniQuiz

This project was created to combine Japanese Anime into a fun and interactive trivia activity that allows the user to challenge themselves.

# Description

This application fetches an API from "Open Trivia DB" to supply the application with answers in regards to the questions provided. Some of the challenges I faced were randomizing the questions after the user restarts the game. I also found it challenging dealing with incorrect answers in the index.

The technologies used in this project were:

HTML
React
CSS
Javascript

I used this tech stack as I found it necessary to complete the logic and functionality. In the future I would like to expand my learning to other technologies available.

# Motivation

My motivation for this project consists of being an avid watcher and reader of anime and manga so naturally I found it very engaging to be involved in the process of creating and deploying an application where I had a lot of desire to complete the project to the best of my ability.
